# Apex Arc Engine Architecture

## Overview
The Apex Arc Engine predicts MLB home runs using real-time data, advanced metrics, and ethical features.

## Directory Structure
- `api/`: FastAPI endpoints for predictions.
- `data_ingestion/`: Real-time and historical data pipelines.
- `prediction/`: Core prediction logic.
- `modeling/`: Machine learning models.
- `ethical/`: Explainability and responsible betting.

## Data Flow
1. Fetch data via `data_ingestion/`.
2. Compute features in `feature_engineering/`.
3. Apply overlays in `overlays/`.
4. Generate predictions in `prediction/`.
5. Serve via `api/` and display in `ui/`.
